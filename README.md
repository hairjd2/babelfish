# Flutter App
For the flutter app, the code is inside app/babel_fish. When you download the code for yourself to build the app, make sure to run flutter pub get. The site to download and setup flutter development is here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
# Raspberry Pi Code
We recommend using a raspberry pi 3/4. For now, this repo does not include the node server code to listen for the app, but that will come later.
